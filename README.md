## GPUImage Swift Redux
This is a fork of Brad Larson's [GPUImage2](https://github.com/BradLarson/GPUImage2) with the goal of submitting pull requests to advance that project.

I'm adding a DSL to unify the GL & GLES codebase, remove shaders from strings, and add compiler warnings for vertex & fragment shaders.

I'm also looking to add as many features that Brad has listed [in this issue](https://github.com/BradLarson/GPUImage2/issues/75) as possible
